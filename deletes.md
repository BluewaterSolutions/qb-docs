## Deletes

The query builder may also be used to delete records from the table via the `delete` method. You may constrain `delete` statements by adding `where` clauses before calling the `delete` method:

DB::table('users')->delete();

DB::table('users')->where('votes', '>', 100)->delete();

If you wish to truncate the entire table, which will remove all rows and reset the auto-incrementing ID to zero, you may use the `truncate` method:

DB::table('users')->truncate();
